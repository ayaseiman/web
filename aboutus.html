				<h3><em>How is Bolashaq vision different from other educational agencies abroad?</em></h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Bolashaq vision is a professional team of international education specialists. We specialise in
					higher education abroad and in obtaining financial aid to study abroad. We also act as an
					information portal, publishing information about
					scholarships and grants for students from Kazakhstan abroad.

					ALL of our specialists have studied and worked abroad, had internships and work placements in
					various countries of the world. And each of us knows what a successful application package for
					admission to a foreign university and obtaining funding
					should look like, as well as what it takes to go to a foreign internship or conference.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr size='2' noshade color='#1d3b5c'>
			<div>
				<h3><em>In which countries is it possible to study for free?</em></h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>In almost any country in the world. To do so, you will need to find programmes and universities that
					offer scholarships (private or governmental) or contact us to select such programmes and prepare a
					strong application pack for each
					programme.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr size='2' noshade color='#1d3b5c'>
			<div>
				<h3><em>Are there entrance exams for admission to a foreign university?</em></h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>Entrance examinations for admission to universities abroad are rare. However, almost all
					universities require proof of foreign language skills. The most common tests in English are the
					TOEFL and IELTS.

					If you are applying to a professional program such as MBA, you will need to take the GMAT (of course
					there are some exceptions, but if you are applying for funding you will need to take the test), or
					another professional test.

					If your goal is the US or Canada and a master's degree or higher, you will need to take the GRE to
					get in. If you want to enter an undergraduate program in these countries, you will need to take the
					SAT or ACT along with the English language
					test.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr size='2' noshade color='#1d3b5c'>
			<div>
				<h3><em>What if I want to apply to several universities?</em></h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>You can submit an unlimited number of applications to universities. However, you will need to
					prepare the required number of original diplomas with transcripts and references, as each of the
					universities will need to submit the original.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr size='2' noshade color='#1d3b5c'>
			<div>
				<h3><em>Do you guarantee that if I apply to you, I will get a scholarship and go to university?</em>
				</h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>No. We can only guarantee that your applications are professionally prepared and of a higher quality
					than those of other applicants. However, applications are reviewed by universities and no one can
					influence their decision. When you apply
					for a scholarship, we assess the chances of applicants. If they are few, we advise to defer
					admission when the applicant has gained more experience/knowledge, etc. If we decide to work with an
					applicant, we understand that they have a very high
					chance of admission/fellowship and help them prepare a decent application package that will help
					them get the coveted letter of admission.

					We can only guarantee admission on a fee basis.</li>
			</ul>
			<hr size='2' noshade color='#1d3b5c'>
			<div>
				<h3><em>When should I start enrolling abroad so that I am not too late?</em></h3>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>It is best to apply in advance. We recommend that our clients start preparing and working a year and
					a half before they intend to study.</li>
			</ul>

								Elena Mulgacheva, Moscow <br>
								The Bolashaq Vision team helped me with completing the university applications and
								collecting documents as well as giving me advice on how to apply. This made the
								admission process a lot easier for me, which can be handled on my own, but it takes a
								lot more time and nerves, and there is always the risk of getting something wrong. In
								addition, Education Index helped me by making calls to the universities if I had any
								questions. In the end I got into my highest priority university.

								Stanislava Stashchenko, Kiev <br> Initially my goal was to get a master's degree at
								Oxford University. Unfortunately, I could not find competent advisers in my country.
								After a search engine search I found Bolashaq Vision and was amazed at how informative
								my initial call was regarding studying abroad. Through the process of dialogue I had no
								doubt that they were the company I would be working with. I would like to start by
								saying a sincere thank you to their staff for their professionalism, support and
								responsiveness. My path to a British education was extremely thorny and long, but I got
								in, and I got in because of them.

								Aidana Zhanabayeva, Aktobe <br> The manager fully answered my questions and advised me
								on what to do to apply. For the next online meeting, suitable universities were
								prepared. I am writing from Hong Kong University)) Thank you!
