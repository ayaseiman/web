    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <h3><em>How is Bolashaq vision different from other educational agencies abroad?</em></h3>
    </center>
    <ul>
      <li>Bolashaq vision is a professional team of international education specialists. We specialise in higher education abroad and in obtaining financial aid to study abroad. We also act as an information portal, publishing information about scholarships and grants for students from Kazakhstan abroad.

ALL of our specialists have studied and worked abroad, had internships and work placements in various countries of the world. And each of us knows what a successful application package for admission to a foreign university and obtaining funding should look like, as well as what it takes to go to a foreign internship or conference.</li>

      <h3><em>In which countries is it possible to study for free?</em></h3>
      </center>
      <ul>
        <li>In almost any country in the world.  To do so, you will need to find programmes and universities that offer scholarships (private or governmental) or contact us to select such programmes and prepare a strong application pack for each programme.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3><em>Are there entrance exams for admission to a foreign university?</em></h3>
        </center>
        <ul>
          <li>Entrance examinations for admission to universities abroad are rare. However, almost all universities require proof of foreign language skills. The most common tests in English are the TOEFL and IELTS.

If you are applying to a professional program such as MBA, you will need to take the GMAT (of course there are some exceptions, but if you are applying for funding you will need to take the test), or another professional test.

If your goal is the US or Canada and a master's degree or higher, you will need to take the GRE to get in. If you want to enter an undergraduate program in these countries, you will need to take the SAT or ACT along with the English language test.</li>

          <h3><em>What if I want to apply to several universities?</em></h3>
          </center>
          <ul>
            <li>You can submit an unlimited number of applications to universities. However, you will need to prepare the required number of original diplomas with transcripts and references, as each of the universities will need to submit the original.</li>
          </ul>

            <h3><em>Do you guarantee that if I apply to you, I will get a scholarship and go to university?</em></h3>
            </center>
            <ul>
              <li>No. We can only guarantee that your applications are professionally prepared and of a higher quality than those of other applicants. However, applications are reviewed by universities and no one can influence their decision. When you apply for a scholarship, we assess the chances of applicants. If they are few, we advise to defer admission when the applicant has gained more experience/knowledge, etc. If we decide to work with an applicant, we understand that they have a very high chance of admission/fellowship and help them prepare a decent application package that will help them get the coveted letter of admission.

We can only guarantee admission on a fee basis.</li>

              <h3><em>When should I start enrolling abroad so that I am not too late?</em></h3>
              </center>
              <ul>
                <li>It is best to apply in advance. We recommend that our clients start preparing and working a year and a half before they intend to study.</li>
